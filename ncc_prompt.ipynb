       "\"Okay, let’s break down this case and arrive at the most likely diagnosis.\\n\\n**Here’s my assessment as a medical expert:**\\n\\nThis case presents a complex picture, and the combination of developmental delays, lack of motor skills, and unusual behaviors warrants a thorough investigation. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\n*   **A) Language disorder:** While language delays can occur in infants, the *lack* of responding to her name and purposeless movements is less typical of a language disorder. Language skills typically develop at a faster pace than the motor milestones described.\\n\\n*   **B) Rett syndrome:** Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that presents with a constellation of developmental delays, including hypotonia (low muscle tone), seizures, and behavioral challenges. It’s characterized by significant motor milestones being delayed, and a characteristic pattern of repetitive movements and social difficulties. *However, the absence of any significant motor milestones or repetitive movements makes Rett syndrome less likely as the primary diagnosis.*\\n\\n*   **C) Fragile X syndrome:** Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and developmental delays. It often presents with a range of symptoms, including difficulties with motor skills, repetitive behaviors, and speech delays. *The description\""
